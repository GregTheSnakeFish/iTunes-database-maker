# table-scraps
Tiny bits of nonsense that aren't useful to anyone, including myself, but were fun projects for practicing things. 

This is all just little stuff I made to practice my basic programming skills. 

There is a thing that builds an SQL-compliant database of my iTunes library from the XML file generated by iTunes. That was fun.
  I didn't post the XML file because it is already like 45MB. You can make one from your own iTunes if you want.

Idea: A program to convert from Roman numerals to integers.
Idea: A program which returns certain data about my record collection from the Excel file I use to organize it. (Average Year, etc.)
Idea: A program which automatically mangles a given input name a la Steve Brule. Ex: "Cynthia Driscoll" becomes "Cindy Drungus".
Idea: A program which tells you where the nearest parrot is likely to be (seems like it has a lot of room for experimentation and variables).
