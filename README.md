# iTunes database maker

This is all just little stuff I made to practice my basic programming skills. 

This is a thing that builds a SQLite3 database of my iTunes library from the XML file generated by iTunes. You will need to generate your Library.xml file from iTunes and place it in the same folder as the code. You also of course need to have SQLite3.

You can use the included Library.xml if you want. It is about one-fourth of my Library (the full file is way too big for Github), though your primary keys might be a little strange since I just deleted huge chunks of the data to make it smaller for use as a sample.

Please note: I have tons of music for tons of reasons (including musical research), and the language of the nearly 30,000 tracks or beliefs of the nearly 4,000 artists in my Library that I have collected over the last 15 years are not necessarily consistent with my own, or might be appropriate only in certain cultural contexts. Use with discretion.
