# iTunes database maker

This is all just little stuff I made to practice my basic programming skills. 

This is a thing that builds an SQLite3 database of my iTunes library from the XML file generated by iTunes. You will need to generate your Library.XML file from iTunes and place it in the same folder as the code.

Idea: A program which automatically mangles a given input name a la Steve Brule. Ex: "Cynthia Driscoll" becomes "Cindy Drungus".

Idea: A program which displays the current status of several of my favorite websites (not very useful, but good for getting used to different API setups, perhaps).
