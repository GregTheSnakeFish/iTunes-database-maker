# iTunes database maker

This is all just little stuff I made to practice my basic programming skills. 

This is a thing that builds a SQLite3 database of my iTunes library from the XML file generated by iTunes. You will need to generate your Library.XML file from iTunes and place it in the same folder as the code.
