# table-scraps
Tiny bits of nonsense that aren't useful to anyone, including myself, but were/are fun projects for practicing things. 

This is all just little stuff I made to practice my basic programming skills. 

There is a thing that builds an SQL-compliant database of my iTunes library from the XML file generated by iTunes. That was fun.

Idea: A program to convert from Roman numerals to integers. (in progress)

Idea: A program which returns certain data about my record collection from the Excel file I use to organize it. (Average Year, etc.)

Idea: A program which automatically mangles a given input name a la Steve Brule. Ex: "Cynthia Driscoll" becomes "Cindy Drungus".

Idea: A program which tells you where the nearest parrot is likely to be (seems like it has a lot of room for experimentation and variables).

Idea: A program which displays the current status of several of my favorite websites (not very useful, but good for getting used to different API setups, perhaps).

Idea: A program which, given a regular expression, does something else related to that regular expression but not quite the same as searching for a string. (this is a loose idea, not sure what I mean by this yet.)
